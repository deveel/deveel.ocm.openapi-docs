# Omni-Channel Messaging

The interface provided by this system supports a unified messaging experience, allowing users to send or receive messages through multiple types of messaging channels (eg. _SMS_, _WhatsApp_, _E-mail_, etc.).

Messages that go from a client application of Deveel OCM to an individual are named _outbound messages_, while the messages incoming from individuals to a client application (through webhook callbacks) are named _inbound messages_: it will be possible to find several time in these documents reference to such directions.
