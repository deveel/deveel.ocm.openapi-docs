## Deveel Omni-Channel Messaging

This space provides the documentation for the Deveel OCM platform, a messaging infrastructure that provides a unified messaging experience, allowing users to send or receive messages through multiple types of messaging channels (eg. _SMS_, _WhatsApp_, _E-mail_, etc.).

Please note that you will find a mix of technical details (eg. _how to authenticate the client applications_, _the format of the messages_, _how to create a channel_, etc.) and conceptual definitions: given the current scarcity of resources, we cannot provide dedicated spaces for the business aspects and the technology aspects, that will eventually be separated.

> :warning: **Note**: The platform is currently under development, that reflects in the changeable nature of the documentation provided in these pages
